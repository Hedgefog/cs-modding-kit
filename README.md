## 🛠️ Modding Kit 🇺🇦

### 📄 About
__CS Modding Kit__ is a powerful solutions for Amx Mod X modding that can be used to create complex mods for a short time with flexible solutions using a unified development approach. I continue working on this repository and plan many new solutions in the future as well as move my mods to this solution to create examples and a good code base. Focus on game logic instead of crutches for native stuff.

### ❔Why Modding Kit?
- Powerful, rasy to use and flexible game systems
- Unified system easy to maintain
- Cross-game development (you can create mods that will work with both **Counter-Strike** and **Half-Life**)
